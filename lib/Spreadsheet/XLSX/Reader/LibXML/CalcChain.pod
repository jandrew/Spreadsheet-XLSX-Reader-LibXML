=head1 NAME

Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::CalcChain - Read xlsx calcChain files with LibXML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The following uses the 'calcChain.xml' file found in the t/test_files/xl/ folder.  
It also uses the XMLReader version of the CalcChain class.  Any version will do.


	
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    $|=1;
    use Data::Dumper;
    use Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::Error;
    use Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::XMLReader::CalcChain;

    my $file_instance = Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::XMLReader::CalcChain->new(
                            file_name => 'calcChain.xml',
							error_inst => Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::Error->new,
                        );
    print Dumper( $file_instance->get_calc_chain_position( 2 ) );
	
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This general class is written to access the sub file calcChain in an unzipped .xlsx file.  The 
file is generally found in the xl/ folder of the unzipped file.  This file contains the calculation 
sequence and data source used for identified formulas in the sheet.  (The formula tie to these 
elements is maintained outside of this sheet.  To build it differently you would need to fork the 
L<github|https://github.com/jandrew/Spreadsheet-XLSX-Reader-LibXML> package and insert the call for 
this class in the $parser_modules variable maintained in the L<Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML> 
class.  (about line 34).  Each individual type of CalcChain reader '.pm' file also has it's own POD.
	
=head2 Primary Methods

These are the primary ways to use this class.  For additional calcChain options see the 
L<Attributes|/Attributes> section.

=head3 get_calc_chain_position( $integer )

=over

B<Definition:> This will return the calcChain information from the identified $integer position.  
(Counting from zero).  The information is returned as a perl hash ref.

B<Accepts:> an $integer for the calcChain position

B<Returns:> a hash ref of data

=back

=head2 Attributes

Data passed to new when creating an instance.   For modification of 
these attributes see the listed 'attribute methods'. For more information on 
attributes see L<Moose::Manual::Attributes>.

=head3 file_name

=over

B<Definition:> This needs to be the full file path to the calcChain file to 
be parsed.

B<Required:> Yes

B<Default:> none

B<Range> an actual Excel 2007+ calcChain file

B<attribute methods> Methods provided to adjust this attribute
		
=back

=head4 get_file_name

=over

=head3 error_inst

=over

B<Definition:> Currently all CalcChain readers require an 
L<Error|Spreadsheet::XLSX::Reader::LibXML::Error> instance.

B<Required:> Yes

B<Default:> none

B<Range:> The minimum list of methods to implement for your own instance is;

	error set_error clear_error set_warnings if_warn

B<attribute methods> Methods provided to adjust this attribute
		
=back

=head4 get_error_inst

=over

B<Definition:> returns this instance

=back

=head4 error

=over

B<Definition:> Used to get the most recently logged error

=back

=head4 set_error

=over

B<Definition:> used to set a new error string

=back

=head4 clear_error

=over

B<Definition:> used to clear the current error string in this attribute

=back

=head4 set_warnings

=over

B<Definition:> used to turn on or off real time warnings when errors are set

=back

=head4 if_warn

=over

B<Definition:> a method mostly used to extend this package and see if warnings 
should be emitted.
